<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a postdocral scholar at Department of Computational Medicine, UCLA, working with Dr. [Kenneth Lange](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2308441120) and Dr. [Hua Zhou](https://hua-zhou.github.io/). I received my Ph.D. from North Carolina State University, where I primarily worked with Dr. [Eric C. Chi](https://www.ericchi.com/) (currently at Rice) on numerical optimization in statistical learning problems.
