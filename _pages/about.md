<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a final-year PhD student in Statistics at North Carolina State University. Before coming to NC State, I received my Bachelor's degree from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE). During my PhD, I primarily worked with Dr. [Eric C. Chi](https://www.ericchi.com/) (currently at Rice) on numerical optimization and Bayesian computation in statistical learning problems. 


# üî• News
- *2023.06*: &nbsp; I will join Department of Computational Medicine, UCLA as a postdocral scholar this fall, primarily working with Dr. [Kenneth Lange](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2308441120) and Dr. [Hua Zhou](https://hua-zhou.github.io/).
